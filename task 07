// Q . Create a program that asks the user for their nationality, gender, and age using the prompt
// function. The program should then use nested if-else statements to determine if the
// person is eligible to vote.
// First, the program should check if the person is Pakistani or Indian. If they are not, the
// program should display a message saying they are not eligible to vote.
// If they are Pakistani or Indian, the program should then check their gender. If the person is
// male and over the age of 18, they are eligible to vote. If the person is female and over the
// age of 18, the program should ask if they are married. If they are married, they are eligible
// to vote. If they are not married, they are not eligible to vote.
// If the person is under 18, the program should display a message saying they are not eligible
// to vote.
